# Overview

Using Python's Pygame module, this program's purpose was to be able to program a game that displayed graphics, used user control, and had moveable objects. 

The game I designed was a simple "Snake" game. Use the arrow keys to move, collect as many purple "fruits" to grow bigger and gain more points. If you end up running into yourself, you lose! In this iteration of the game, the screen wraps so the player does not die if they run into the edge.
